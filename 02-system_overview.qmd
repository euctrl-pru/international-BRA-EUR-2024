This section presents a broad introduction to the air navigation systems of Brazil and Europe. In broad strokes, the provision of air navigation services in both regions relies on similar operational concepts, procedures, and supporting technology. Nonetheless, there are several distinctions between the two systems, which help to account for the similarities and differences in key performance indicators documented in this report.

## Organisation of Air Navigation Services

One of the critical distinctions between the air navigation systems of Brazil and Europe still lies in their respective organisational structures. In Brazil, a single entity serves as the primary air navigation services provider, known as the Department of Airspace Control (DECEA). In contrast, in Europe, each member state has delegated the responsibility for service provision to either national or local providers.

DECEA holds the vital role of overseeing all activities related to the safety and efficiency of Brazilian airspace control. Its mission encompasses the management and control of all air traffic within the sovereign Brazilian airspace, with a significant emphasis on contributing to national defence efforts. To achieve this, DECEA operates a comprehensive and fully integrated civil-military system.

In 2021, a public company, NAV Brasil, was created to take over some facilities that were linked to an old airport infrastructure provider company in Brazil (INFRAERO). Today, this company has 1698 employees in 44 different units, providing aerodrome control services, nonradar approach, meteorology and aeronautical information for these locations. Despite having important numbers, Nav Brasil doesn't plan to have radar facilities or en-route services.

The Brazilian airspace, covering an extensive area of approximately 22 million square kilometres (8.5 million square nautical miles in non-oceanic regions), is divided into five Flight Information Regions. These regions are further subdivided and managed by five Area Control Centers (ACC), 57 Tower facilities (TWR), 42 Approach Units (APP) and 84 AFIS/Remote-AFIS.

The non-oceanic airspace in Europe covers an expansive area of 11.5 million square kilometres. When it comes to providing air traffic services, the European approach involves a multitude of service providers, with 37 distinct en-route Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), each responsible for different geographical regions. These services are primarily organised along state boundaries and FIR (Flight Information Region) borders, with limited cross-border agreements in place between adjacent airspaces and air traffic service units.

A noteworthy exception to this predominantly national approach is the Maastricht Upper Area Control (UAC), which represents a unique multinational collaboration offering air traffic services in the upper airspace of northern Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

Civil-military integration levels across European countries vary. Within this European context, the central coordination of Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) and Airspace Management (ASM) is facilitated by the Network Manager. The design of airspace and related procedures is no longer developed and implemented in isolation in Europe. Inefficiencies in the design and utilisation of the air route network are recognised as contributing factors to flight inefficiencies in the region. Therefore, as part of the European Commission's Single European Sky initiative, the Network Manager is tasked with developing an integrated European Route Network Design. This is achieved through a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) process involving all stakeholders.

Another critical responsibility of the Network Manager is to ensure that air traffic flows do not exceed the safe handling capacity of air traffic service units while optimising available capacity. To accomplish this, the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) continuously monitors the air traffic situation and proposes flow management measures through the CDM process, coordinating with the respective local authorities. This coordination typically occurs with the local Flow Management Positions (FMP) within area control centres. Subsequently, the NMOC implements the relevant flow management initiatives as requested by the authorities or FMPs.

## High Level System Comparison

@fig-HLC2022 summarizes the key characteristics of the Brazilian and European air navigation system for 2022. Comparing the high-level numbers, Brazil shows an increased number of ATCOs even with the pandemic period. In contrast, the European system showed a not negligible reduction.Those numbers show a significant reaction capacity difference between the systems. The distinction can be partly explained by the fact that DECEA shares part of the structure used in basic training with other Air Force training processes. This leads to a more centralised and rigid process, in which abrupt reactions in hiring planning are unwanted due to the lengthy process of calling for candidates according to Brazilian laws related to public jobs. European providers are more independent and flexible and could stop contracting more easily during uncertain times.

Another point that claims attention is the movement levels. Unlike in Europe, it is interesting to note that Brazil ended 2022, already moving above 2019 levels of movement. However, as will be seen later, much of this was due to the increase in general and not in commercial aviation.

Both regions operate with similar operational concepts, procedures and supporting technology. Yet, Brazil, with lower traffic density related to airspace use, finds probably a more challenging cost-benefit ratio to maintain communications coverage and surveillance for low-traffic regions. In comparison, the European region faces more considerable challenges in coordinating efforts to avoid congestion due to a higher density.

Yet, this report launched a first analysis of the systems' network utilisation, taking advantage of this rich experience in comparing two great aviation systems. Aviation infrastructure is always expansive and complex to maintain, Air Navigation Services are included in this concept. The analysis of the facilities' locations distribution for this service has always basically accompanied the distribution of airports in a region. Recently, technological feasibility modified this logic with the possibility of remote services and still with the possibility of joining more than one remote installation to provide services to several locations simultaneously.

Still, a closer look at the dynamics of these routes and potential connectivity between sites may indicate the potential for capacity to be exploited by the aviation community or that idle capacity is installed without reasonable prospects for use.

In @fig-Apt_Rank_Comparison2022, we see the distribution of commercial departures for 2022 in both regions. Note that the concentration is proportionally slightly higher on the Brazilian side, with less than 50 airports absorbing 80% of the commercial takeoffs that year. In comparison, the European system distributed this same percentage in approximately 100 airports. In any case, most airports receiving commercial flights correspond to only 1% of this movement; in both systems, this represents more than half of the airports that serve commercial flights. In Europe, approximately 486 airports receive only 1% of the movement, while in Brazil, there are 210 for the same percentage. Despite being an already historically established distribution and somewhat expected, the aviation sector agents must revisit this data constantly to verify the waste of installed capacity and possible relocations to accommodate the balance between demand and capacity better.

Analyzing the part of the ANS, specifically on the Brazilian side, we have that the proportion of flights using AFIS aerodromes in this sample is 10.73%. Among them, the busiest airport had approximately 4146 commercial departures in 2022, and the most flat only 124. Despite claiming attention, in most cases, those represent very isolated airports where aviation is deemed needed to give access to that community. The European data available for this work still needs to be suitable for filtering AFIS airports.

Further research can explore how both regions can maximize installed capacity and suggest improvements for ANS providers.

## Regional Approach to Operational Performance Monitoring

The previous report detailed the historic setup of the performance monitoring systems in Brazil and Europe. However, it is fundamental to emphasise that the Performance Review Commission (PRC) was established within EUROCONTROL in 1998 to address European air traffic management (ATM) performance following the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Institutional Strategy. Its main goal is to offer impartial advice on pan-European ATM performance to EUROCONTROL's governing bodies. Supported by the Performance Review Unit (PRU), the PRC conducts extensive research, data analysis, and consultations to provide objective insights and recommendations. EUROCONTROL's performance review system, a pioneering initiative in the late 1990s, has influenced broader forums like ICAO's global performance approach and the Single European Sky (SES) performance scheme. Collaborating internationally, particularly with ICAO, the PRC aims to harmonize air navigation practices. The PRC produces annual reports (ACE and PRR) and provides operational performance monitoring through various data products and online tools. Continuous efforts are made to expand online reporting for stakeholders, ensuring access to independent performance data for informed decision-making.

It is noteworthy to recall that DECEA, influenced by ICAO publications, embraced a performance-based approach, notably advancing with EUROCONTROL's collaboration. Beginning with the SIRIUS Brazil Program in 2012, DECEA faced challenges defining metrics but made significant progress after signing a Cooperation Agreement in 2015. They published crucial documents for ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan, prompting organizational transformation. Establishing the ATM Performance Section in 2019, akin to EUROCONTROL's unit, DECEA accelerated expertise in operational performance monitoring, culminating in their first ATM Performance Plan for 2022-2023. Actively fostering an open culture of knowledge-sharing within South America, DECEA engaged in workshops and seminars, inviting EUROCONTROL for collaboration.

Finally, it should be noted that the recurrent use of indicators by EUROCONTROL and DECEA and the deep debates that take place during the analysis periods for joint conclusions enrich not only the two regions but also have a global impact. Embracing transparency, both agencies made indicators and databases publicly accessible, perpetuating a culture of reciprocity and transparency for mutual advancement. Looking for broader validation and harmonization, the lessons learned from this scheme are systematically shared with the multinational Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) and the subgroup of the ICAO GANP Study, which deals with the development of GANP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Thus, this work also subsidizes the development of ATM performance management throughout the world aviation community.

## Summary

While both regions operate on similar operational concepts and technologies, distinctions arise from their organizational structures. Brazil's air navigation services are centralized under DECEA, overseeing all airspace control and contributing significantly to national defense. In contrast, Europe's services are provided by multiple entities, with various Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) operating along state boundaries and FIR borders.

Also remarkable is the comparison of air traffic controller (ATCO) numbers between Brazil and Europe during the pandemic, which reveals contrasting trends. Brazil experienced an increase in ATCOs, while Europe witnessed a notable reduction. This disparity underscores a significant difference in the systems' responsiveness, partly attributed to Brazil's centralized and rigid hiring process. At the same time, European providers operate with greater independence and flexibility, enabling easier adjustments in contracting, particularly during doubtful times.

The distribution of 2022 commercial flights indicates that fewer airports handle 80% of commercial takeoffs; Brazil has a slightly higher concentration than Europe. In any case, most airports operating commercial flights represent just 1% of the movement in both systems and constant review by aviation stakeholders to manage installed capacity efficiently is strongly recommended.

The strengthening collaboration between DECEA and EUROCONTROL is noted again. The effort benefits the two regions and contributes globally by sharing insights and lessons learned with international aviation communities, aiding the development of ATM performance management worldwide.
