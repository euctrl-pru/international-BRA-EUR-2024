The aviation community has institutionally embraced the assessment of its environment impact.
During the 40th ICAO Assembly in 2019, two global aspirational goals were agreed upon to mitigate the impact of the international aviation sector.
These goals entail an annual fuel efficiency improvement of 2% until 2050 and achieving carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onwards (as outlined in ICAO (2019b)).
Nations worldwide have set ambitious political targets to address the effects of climate change.
For instance, the European Union introduced its Green Deal (European Commission (2019)) and the Fit-for-55 initiative, which aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels (as stated in the European Commission (2021)).
